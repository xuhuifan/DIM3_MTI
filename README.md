MTI for Dynamic Infinite Mixed-Membership Stochastic Blockmodel

This is an implementation of MTI model in the paper of "Dynamic Infinite Mixed-Membership Stochastic Blockmodel".

Dear Readers,

This is the experimental code of the "Dynamic Infinite Mixed-Membership Stochastic Blockmodel", conducted by Xuhui Fan.

For an initial trial, please run the DIM_GIBBS.m, DIM_SLICE.m, MTI_GIBBS.m for the model of MTV-g, MTV-s, MTI. This is an experiment on the Enron Dataset.

The Enron dataset can be freely download from the Internet. For our usage, we have compressed the dataset size to our fitted size.

Please feel free to use it. I appreciate a lot if you find any bugs inside the code and told me :). Thanks in advance!

Best regards,

Xuhui Fan
